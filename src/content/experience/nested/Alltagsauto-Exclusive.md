## Alltagsauto-Exclusive
Alltagsauto-Exclusive is a premium car rental service project developed for the Swiss-based startup Alltagsauto Group. As part of their business expansion, they needed a dedicated web platform exclusively for high-end cars. This project involved creating a sophisticated e-commerce style website where only the administrator can post available offers, and users can request the product by contacting via email or phone.
