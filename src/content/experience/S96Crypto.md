## S96: Your CryptoBank

In the "S96:Your CryptoBank" project, I leveraged technologies such as ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, CSS Modules, and Styled Components. This personal project aimed to showcase the use of React and PostgreSQL, implementing features like controlled forms for login and registration, as well as a scheduling system integrated with the database.
